// Stryker mutation testing config.
//
// Why: example-based tests can pass while still leaving code paths
// unguarded — change `>` to `>=`, drop a condition, swap a literal, and
// nothing fails. The 5 bugs we shipped to 2.1.4/2.1.5 were all of this
// kind. Mutation testing proves whether tests actually defend the
// implementation, not just touch its lines.
//
// Usage:
//   pnpm build           # mutation runs against ts via vitest, no built dist needed
//   pnpm test:mutation   # full run
//
// Not wired into CI yet — full mutation run is expensive (≈10-30 min)
// and is best invoked on demand or on a nightly schedule once the team
// has a baseline mutation score they want to defend.
