/**
 * Architectural-change taxonomy for `aact diff`. The output is a
 * Terraform-style domain-grouped change log: every change identifies
 * an entity, an action, and the specific fields that moved. Optional
 * RFC 6902 `patch[]` rides along for tooling that wants to replay the
 * delta on a normalized Model JSON.
 *
 * Why domain-grouped and not pure JSON Patch? Agents reading the
 * envelope reason about "what architecturally changed" — `added
 * relation web → api (HTTP)` is a useful sentence, whereas
 * `{op: "add", path: "/elements/web/relations/3", value: {…}}` forces
 * the consumer to re-derive intent. We keep both: the semantic layer
 * is primary, the patch layer is opt-in for round-trip.
 *
 * Severity heuristic (not configurable — kept neutral on purpose):
 *  - **structural** — added/removed elements, boundaries, relations;
 *    moves between boundaries; element/boundary kind transitions.
 *  - **semantic**   — technology / external / tags / order / properties
 *    changes; relation `from→to` technology swap (post-process collapse).
 *  - **cosmetic**   — label, description, sprite, link, workspace
 *    metadata.
 *
 * Renames are detected within the same `kind` only, with a similarity
 * score surfaced as `confidence`. Threshold defaults to 0.7; agents
 * gate on `confidence` if they want stricter rename behaviour.
