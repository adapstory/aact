/**
 * `model-json` generator. Emits the canonical format-level shape
 * `{ schemaVersion: 1, model: Model }` — distinct from
 * `aact model --json` which wraps the same Model in `CliEnvelope`
 * with CLI-level meta (durationMs, command, configPath).
 *
 * The Format-API `generate(model)` is a pure function: no access to
 * runtime context, no envelope semantics. So this output is the
 * lean, format-neutral snapshot — suitable for git-committing as
 * a baseline, sharing between tools, or replaying through
 * `aact diff`. Symmetric to `JSON.parse(generate(model)) → load(...)`
 * — the canonical round-trip.
 *
 * `sourceLocation` is preserved on emit when present on the input
 * Model. Consumers that need a "logical only" dump can strip it
 * themselves; we never invent or fabricate the field. When the
 * source was originally PUML/DSL, sourceLocation points at lines
 * in that source — accurate as long as the user keeps the source
 * file around at the same path.
 *
 * **Determinism.** Element / Boundary records are written with keys
 * sorted alphabetically so two generates from the same Model
 * produce byte-identical output. Without this, the `Object.values`
 * insertion order leaks parser quirks into the diff, and
 * `aact diff base.aact.json base.aact.json` would show phantom
 * moves whenever the parser reordered loaders internally.

// valid for the lifetime of the repo — `main` never goes away and
// the file is checked in alongside this code.

// on `main` for a release cycle, opening a `SchemaStore/schemastore`
// PR with `fileMatch: ["*.aact.json"]` lets VSCode / JetBrains / Zed
// auto-attach the schema even without the `$schema` field. We keep
// emitting the field regardless — editors that haven't synced the
// catalog, or files renamed outside `*.aact.json`, still resolve it.
