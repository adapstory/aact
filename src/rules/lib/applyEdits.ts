/**
 * Pure byte-splicer for `SourceEdit`s. Edits carry full `SourceLocation`
 * byte ranges (loaders populate them on every Element / Boundary /
 * Relation), so the applier never has to match text patterns or guess
 * which line is meant. Three rules:
 *
 *   1. Edits are applied in *reverse* offset order. That way splicing
 *      earlier offsets never shifts the byte coordinates of later
 *      edits — the same pattern LSP / VS Code's `TextDocumentEdit`
 *      uses.
 *   2. Two edits whose touched ranges overlap conflict. The applier
 *      keeps the first one (in input order) and reports the
 *      subsequent ones as `conflicts` — the CLI surfaces them as
 *      warnings instead of silently dropping a partial edit.
 *   3. Insertion (`insert-after` / `insert-before`) is just a splice
 *      at a single offset with zero-width "range". `content` is
 *      written verbatim — rules emit the newline + indentation they
 *      want; the applier does not interpret formatting.
 *
 * Returns the new content plus structured metadata. The CLI uses
 * `applied` to count successful fixes and `conflicts` to emit
 * diagnostics; library consumers can do the same. The function is
 * agnostic to source format — it works on PUML, Structurizr DSL,
 * Kubernetes YAML, or anything else byte-addressable.
